# Predication-of-rain-in-Australia
Data pre-processing, analyzing, training of logistic regression, scores, cross-validation

### Goal 

This project was my first data science project (March 2020). 

The aim of this project is to predict whether it will rain the next day in Australia. To do this, we will use supervised learning and more precisely a binary classification. The main steps of the project are : analysis of the dataset, data preparation, model training, model testing and model improvement.
