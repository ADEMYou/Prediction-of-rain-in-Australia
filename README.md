This project was my first data science project (March 2020). 

### Goal 

The aim of this project is to predict whether it will rain the next day in Australia. To do this, we will use supervised learning and more precisely a binary classification. The main steps of the project are : analysis of the dataset, data preparation, model training, model testing and model improvement.
